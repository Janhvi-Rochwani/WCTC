### WCTC: Who Compiles the Compiler
A compiler made as a part of the course project for the course [CS335: Compiler Design](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/swarnendu/courses/spring2023-cs335/) at IIT-K in 2022-23 II Sem. in a team of three (Soham [CrypthiccCrypto](https://github.com/CrypthiccCrypto) Samaddar, Janhvi [Janhvi-Rochwani](https://github.com/Janhvi-Rochwani) Rochwani, and me, Aditya [cliche-niche](cliche-niche) Tanwar).

### Milestone 1
Make a lexer and a parser for [Java 17](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/index.html) which can generate ASTs for correct Java programs.

### Milestone 2
Extend the compiler to generate [3AC (three address code)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-address_code) for correct Java programs. Report errors like type errors, if any.

### Milestone 3
Extend the 3AC to include stack pointer manipulations.

### Milestone 4
Extend the compiler to generate x86_64 assembly code which can be compiled using gcc.
